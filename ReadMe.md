# DeepFake Detection Models

This repository contains code on detecting DeepFakes using a hybrid CNN–LSTM architecture. The goal is to distinguish real from fake videos by extracting spatial features with ResNeXt‑50 and modeling temporal dynamics with LSTM layers.

I train and evaluate the same model on two datasets:

1. **DFDC (DeepFake Detection Challenge)**
2. **AvLips (LipSync) / LipSync Dataset**

## 🚀 Overview

As part of my undergraduate capstone, I built a DeepFake detection pipeline. It:

* Samples and preprocesses video frames uniformly
* Extracts frame-level features using a pre-trained ResNeXt‑50 backbone
* Refines features with residual blocks
* Models frame sequences with an LSTM
* Outputs binary predictions (real vs. fake)
* Reports accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sangeetanandanvishal04/deepfake_detection.git
   cd deepfake_detection
   ```
2. Install Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Note**: For GPU training on Colab, use the CUDA build:
>
> ```bash
> pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
> ```

## 📥 Data Preparation

### DFDC Dataset

* The notebook downloads `dfdc_dataset.zip` via `gdown` and extracts into `data/dfdc_dataset/real` and `.../fake`.

### AvLips Dataset

* Provide your AvLips archive’s Google Drive file ID in the notebook.
* The same download-and-extract flow populates `data/avlips_dataset/real` and `.../fake`.

## 🏃‍♂️ Training Instructions

Adjust hyperparameters at the top of the notebook:

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 8
NUM_EPOCHS = 10
learning_rate = 1e-5
weight_decay = 1e-6
```

### Train on DFDC

1. Ensure `DATASET_FOLDER = Path("data/dfdc_dataset")`.
2. Run all cells to preprocess, define model, and train.

### Train on AvLips

1. Change to `DATASET_FOLDER = Path("data/avlips_dataset")`.
2. Run preprocessing and training cells again.

## 📊 Evaluation & Metrics

After training, the notebook computes these metrics on both train/test splits:

* Loss (training vs. test)
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1‑score
* Confusion matrix

---

## 📈 Results Visualization

Loss and accuracy curves are plotted using `matplotlib`. You can extend this to TensorBoard or other visualization tools.
